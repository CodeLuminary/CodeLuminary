<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Victor Ijoni</h1>

I have been actively programming since 2012 with C programming language as my first language and since 2012 I have worked with C, C++, Java, Android development, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla, REACT, VueJs, NodeJs, Angular), Python, Solidity and Go.

I delved into DevOps in 2022 starting with AWS and included Azure and Google cloud subsequently

I am a graduate of electrical/electronics engineering (2012-2016) where I mastered electronics design and construction, PCB design, Microcontroller programming through self-development and lots of hardwork.

In 2024, during my masters in Biomedical engineering, I delved into machine learning/AI with application in the medical field.
